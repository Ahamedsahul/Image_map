    <p>Tiruvannamalai (Tamil: Tiruvaṇṇāmalai IPA: ˈtiɾɯʋaɳːaːmalɛi̯, otherwise spelt Thiruvannamalai; Trinomali or Trinomalee[3] on British records) is a city, a spiritual, cultural, economic hub and also the administrative headquarters of Tiruvannamalai District in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The city is home to the renowned Annamalaiyar temple, Annamalai hill, Girivalam and the Karthigai Deepam festival and a prominent pilgrimage destination.[4]

        Tiruvannamalai has a thriving service sector industry, including retail, resorts and recreation activities. Apart from the service sector, the city is also the hub for many industrial setups including SIDCO,[5][6] spinning mills and premier educational institutions.[7][8] The city is administered by the Tiruvanamalai City Municipal Corporation, originally constituted in the year 1886 as Tiruvannamalai Municipality.[9] The city has a good network of roadways and railways connecting it with Chennai (150 km) and Bengaluru (145 km). The Union Ministry of Civil Aviation is considering setting up a new airport at Tiruvannamalai.[10]In Hinduism, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once closed the eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light was taken from the universe, and the earth, in turn, was submerged in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance with other devotees of Shiva, and her husband appeared as a big column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world.[11] He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva.[12] The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake.[13] The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.[14] Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.[15][16] Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.[15] In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the city.[16] The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.[17]</p>
